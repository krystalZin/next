                    Building my webpage with Next.js was an exciting journey, and here&apos;s how I approached it:
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong className="text-lg">Project Structure:</strong> I began by exploring the default project structure created by Next.js. Understanding the purpose of directories like pages, components, and public helped me organize my code efficiently.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong className="text-lg">Creating Pages:</strong> Taking advantage of file-based routing, I created pages inside the pages directory. Each file in this directory became a route, simplifying navigation and organization.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong className="text-lg">Styling Your Components:</strong> Choosing a styling approach was a key decision. I opted for Tailwind CSS to encapsulate styles, making it easier to manage and apply styles to my components for a cohesive look and feel.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong className="text-lg">Reusing Components:</strong> I embraced a modular approach, creating reusable components that could adapt to different parts of my application. This not only improved efficiency but also made my codebase more maintainable.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong className="text-lg">Deployment:</strong> Choosing Netlify as my hosting platform made deployment seamless. The integration with Next.js projects simplified the deployment process, allowing me to focus more on building and less on infrastructure.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong className="text-lg">Continuous Improvement:</strong> I adopted a mindset of continuous improvement. Staying updated with Next.js releases, exploring new features, and optimizing my codebase ensured that my webpage remained current, performant, and scalable.
                </p>
